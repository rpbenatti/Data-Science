# Data-Science

## Welcome to my place where I am currently enjoying the Data Science world!

While taking the Data Science course, I had developed some Jupyter notebooks by end of each modules. Please check them below.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Introduction course where I have learned and practice the basics of Pandas to explore some datasets using python and some libraries. Here we had our fisrt challenging exercise:

<a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rpbenatti/Data-Science/blob/master/desafio1-parte2.ipynb">Desafio 1 - Parte 2</a>

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Intermediate** - In this module we started working on our first regressions, either Linear and Logisitic. In addition, we had our second challenging exercise:

**Machine Learning Introduction**

**Machine Learning Intermediate - Classification and Ensembles**

**Advanced Topics - Connectivity and Neural Netowrks**

In addition to all of the above, I have also reading several articles in some amazing places that I really recommend to any new Data Science enthusiastic:

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://medium.com/">Medium Daily Digest</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/">Towards Data Science</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.datasciencecentral.com/">Data Science Central</a></li>
</ul>

In those I was able to figure out a lot of useful information and learn each day a little bit more.

Check some of my notebooks I am creating so I can review them later:
