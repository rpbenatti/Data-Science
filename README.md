# Data-Science

## Welcome to my place where I am currently enjoying the Data Science world!

While taking the Data Science course, I had developed some Jupyter notebooks by end of each modules we have:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Introduction course where I have learned and practice the basics of Pandas to explore some datasets using python and some libraries. Here we had our fisrt challenging exercise:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - In this module we started working on our first regressions, either Linear and Logisitic. In addition, we had our second challenging exercise:
