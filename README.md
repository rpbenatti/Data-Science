# Data-Science

## Welcome to my place where I am currently enjoying the Data Science world!

While taking the Data Science course, I had developed some Jupyter notebooks by end of each modules. Please check them below.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Introduction course where I have learned and practice the basics of Pandas to explore some datasets using python and some libraries. Here we had our fisrt challenging exercise:

<a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rpbenatti/Data-Science/blob/master/desafio1-parte2.ipynb">Desafio 1 - Parte 2</a>

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Intermediate** - In the second module we started working on our first regressions, either Linear and Logistic. In addition, we had our second challenging exercise:

**Machine Learning Introduction** - In the third module we started implementing our first ML models, supervised and unsupervised, following a ML pipeline (Import, instance, fit, then predict (supervised) or tranform (unsupervised), evaluate and plot). In addition, we had our third challenging exercise:

<a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rpbenatti/Data-Science/blob/master/desafio3_Benatti_v2.ipynb">Desafio 3</a>

<a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rpbenatti/Data-Science/blob/master/DH Desafio 3 Benatti.ipynb">Desafio 3 (EDA+ and additional models)</a>

**Machine Learning Intermediate - Classification and Ensembles** - In the fourht module we started to work with ensembled models, learning the techniques to combine different models into one hence having better performance. In addition, we learned how to interpret the models by using SHAP, LIME and ELI5. Then we had an overview of recommendation systems. In this module we also have some classes regarding Time Series topic. The challenge for this was:

<b>Desafio 4<b>
  Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting
  Forecasting future web traffic values of multiple time series for approximately 145,000 Wikipedia articles.

**Advanced Topics - Connectivity and Neural Networks**

In addition to all of the above, I have also reading several articles in some amazing places that I really recommend to any new Data Science enthusiastic:

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://medium.com/">Medium Daily Digest</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/">Towards Data Science</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.datasciencecentral.com/">Data Science Central</a></li>
</ul>

In those, I was able to figure out a lot of useful information and learn each day a little bit more.

Check also some notebooks I am collecting so I can review them later:

With all that said, I am developing some skills really important in this area!

- Exploratory Data Analysis / EDA (solid understanding of both Descriptive and Inferential Statistics)
- Data wrangling and cleaning
- Metrics and experimentation
- Programming with Python and their related libraries (NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Statsmodel, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Data Analysis using Jupyter tool and Pandas
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib / Seaborn) and Communication (Storytelling)
- Statistical modeling
- Machine Learning modeling
